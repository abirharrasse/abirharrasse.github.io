I am a final year (5th year) engineering student at [EMINES School of Industrial Management](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/), majoring in Data Science. My research interests focus on designing next-generation AI algorithms capable of reasoning. I'm particularly intrigued by the development of more efficient and intelligent AI systems, with a secondary interest in their applications to medicine, including drug discovery and medical diagnosis. Currently, I'm interning at [NUS-IORA](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Chaithanya Bandi](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/bandi-chaithanya/), where we're developing novel evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by social, economic, and voting theories, our goal is to create human-like accurate yet cost-effective assessment methods. In summer 2023, I interned at [Africa Business School](https://abs.um6p.ma/), supervised by [Agnèes Gorge](https://abs.um6p.ma/professors_permanent/agnes-gorge/), working on assortment optimization for major Moroccan retailers like Marjane. I maintain a blog where I share my insights on AI, and I actively participate in hackathons to craft innovative AI solutions - and I won't lie, I love it when I win them :).
