I am a final year (5th year) engineering student at [**EMINES School of Industrial Management**](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/), majoring in Data Science. My research interests focus on designing next-generation AI algorithms capable of reasoning. I'm particularly intrigued by the development of more efficient and intelligent AI systems, with a secondary interest in their applications to medicine, including drug discovery and medical diagnosis.  
Currently, I'm exploring novel evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by social, economic, and voting theories, the goal is to create human-like accurate yet cost-effective assessment methods. In summer 2023, I interned at [**Africa Business School**](https://abs.um6p.ma/), supervised by [Agnès Gorge](https://abs.um6p.ma/professors_permanent/agnes-gorge/), working on assortment optimization for major Moroccan retailers like Marjane.  


I maintain **a blog on medium** where I share my insights on AI, and I actively participate in hackathons to craft innovative AI solutions. I won’t lie, I get a real thrill from winning them 😄.


### Recent news:

- 🎉 April 2024: We're thrilled with the overwhelming success of the first edition of the [**Moroccan Day of Mathematics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RsTD8BXCfQ). It’s incredibly rewarding to see an event I co-founded make such a meaningful impact.

- 🏅 December 2023: Thrilled to share that our medical solution, [SehhaTech](https://github.com/MoroccoAI/2023-GenAI-Hackathon/tree/main/SehhaTech), advanced to the finals of both the **IoT & AI Challenge** and the **MoroccoAI** hackathon. 
- 🏆 October 2023: I had the pleasure of participating in the [**BCG Platinion Hackathon**](https://www.bcgplatinion.com/blog/bcg-platinion-hackathon-aftermovie-2023) and winning first place. Our solution addresses a major aspect of mobility for grocery stores and also functions as a collaborative, optimized platform for emergencies. The idea was inspired by the need for better coordination in the recent earthquake relief efforts in Morocco.
